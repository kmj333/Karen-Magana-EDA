Motivation

I enjoy visiting and providing volunteer work for dogs, and have a dog of my own. As I delved into research about dog shelters, I decided to explore what  dogs are less likely to be adopted in a shelter located in Zurich according to some of the characteristics mentioned in Animals That Are Adopted Last (thesprucepets.com). I was also curious as to how accurately my analysis would reinforce how 20% of dogs (Animals That Are Adopted Last (thesprucepets.com) who enter shelters in America are euthanized.
